# IP Reputation Filtering by Country

This project allows filtering records from a JSON file containing Threat Data Feeds from the **Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal**, which includes IP reputation data based on the **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code**. The primary goal is to process large datasets, identify specific records by country, and generate a filtered file with the results.

## üéØ Features

- **Customizable Filter**: Filter records from a JSON file by country using an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (e.g., `ES` for Spain, `US` for the United States).
- **Error Handling**: Support for missing files, malformed JSON, and unexpected structures.
- **Enriched Results**: Includes the country's name in the output file, along with a timestamp for traceability.
- **`feeds` Work Folder**: All input and output files are processed within the `feeds` folder.

## üîß Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or later.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `pycountry`: To fetch the country's name based on its ISO code.
  - `unittest`: Standard library for running tests.

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Contents of the `requirements.txt` file:

```**Dependencies**
coverage==7.6.10
pycountry==22.3.5
```

## üì• Data Download

### Required data

This project uses **Threat DataFeeds de Kaspersky** to process and filter records by country. Currently, the data must be **manually downloaded** rom the Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal, provided you have the necessary licenses enabled.

**Steps to Download:**

1. Access [Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal](https://tip.kaspersky.com).
2. Log in with your credentials.
3. Download the corresponding data feed (e.g., `IP_Reputation_Data_Feed.json`).
4. Place the downloaded file into the `feeds` folder of the project.
5. Modify the `fichero_entrada` variable in the `filtrado_pais.py` file to match the name of the downloaded data feed.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```plaintext
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feeds/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IP_Reputation_Data_Feed_****.json   # Sample input file
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                                 # Other test files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ filtrado_pais.py                        # Main script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_filtrado_pais.py                   # Automated tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                               # Project documentation
```

## Usage

### 1.  Prepare the `feeds` Folder

Create a folder named `feeds` n the root directory and place the JSON input file inside it. For example:

```plaintext
feeds/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IP_Reputation_Data_Feed_****.json
```

### 2. Run the Main Script

Run the main script to filter records by a specific country code:

```bash
python filtrado_pais.py
```

The output file will be saved in the `feeds` folder with a name that includes the country code and a timestamp, for example:

```plaintext
feeds/IP_Reputation_filtered_ES_*****.json
```

### 3. Modify the Country Code

You can change the country code by modifying the `pais` variable inside `filtrado_pais.py`. For example:

```python
pais = 'ES'  # Change to Spain or any other country
```

## Tests

This project includes a suite of automated tests to validate its functionality. The tests are located in the `test_filtrado_pais.py` file and cover scenarios such as:

- Files with valid records.
- Files with no matching records.
- Empty or malformed JSON files.
- Nonexistent files.

### Run the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test_filtrado_pais.py
```

Expected output if everything works correctly:

```plaintext
Total records processed: 4
Records ignored: 2
2 records found with country = 'ES' (Spain).
Filtered records saved in: feeds/test_filtered_feed.json
...
Ran 5 tests in 0.018s

OK
```

## Example of Input JSON

The file `IP_Reputation_Data_Feed_171224_0757.json` should have a structure similar to the following:

```json
[
    ...
    {
        "id": 1234567890,
        "ip": "203.0.113.42",
        "threat_score": 85,
        "category": "phishing",
        "first_seen": "01.01.2025 12:00",
        "last_seen": "02.01.2025 18:30",
        "popularity": 3,
        "ip_geo": "us",
        "users_geo": "es, fr, de, it, nl",
        "ip_whois": {
            "net_range": "203.0.113.0 - 203.0.113.255",
            "net_name": "ExampleNet",
            "descr": "Example Description for Network Range",
            "created": "15.06.2022",
            "updated": "10.11.2024",
            "country": "US",
            "contact_owner_name": "Example Hosting",
            "contact_owner_code": "ORG-EX123-RIPE"
        }
    },
    ...
]
```

## Example of Filtered JSON

A filtered file for `country = 'ES'` would have the following structure:

```json
[
  ...
    {"ip_whois": {"country": "ES", "org": "ISP Espa√±a"}},
    {"ip_whois": {"country": "ES", "org": "ISP Espa√±a 2"}},
  ...
]
```

## Error Handling

The script handles the following error cases:

1. **File not found**:
   - Mensage: `Error: El archivo 'archivo_inexistente.json' no se encuentra.`
2. **Malformed JSON**:
   - Mensage: `Error: El archivo no es un JSON v√°lido.`
3. **Invalid Structure**:
   - Mensage: `Advertencia: Se encontr√≥ un registro con formato incorrecto y se omiti√≥.`

## üöÄ Next Steps

Here are some ideas to improve and extend this project: (in progress...)

### 1. Geographical vs Administrative Coverage

- Implement the ability to use  **`ip_geo`** or **`ip_whois.country`** as separate or combined filters  (`OR` or `AND`).
- Add detailed classifications to the results, such as:
  - **Geographical**: IPs related to Spain by geolocation (`ip_geo`).
  - **Administrative**: IPs related to Spain by WHOIS registration (`ip_whois.country`).
  - **Both**: IPs meeting both criteria.

### 2. Support for More Input and Output Formats

- **Input**:
  - Add support for other formats such as CSV, Excel, or databases.
  - Allow importing data from APIs from Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal.
- **Output**:
  - Generate reports in formats such as CSV or Excel.
  - Export filtered data to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).

### 3. Filter Optimization

- **Filter Improvements**:
  - Implement additional filters, such as by IP range (`192.168.x.x`), organization, or connection type.
  - Add support for complex rules using regular expressions.
- **Speed**:
  - Use parallel processing techniques to handle large datasets.

### 4. User Interface

- **Command Line**:
  - Integrate  `argparse` to allow users to specify the country code, input file, and output file directly from the terminal.
- **Graphical Interface**:
  - Create a basic graphical interface using libraries such as `tkinter` or `PyQt`.

### 5. Anomaly Detection

- Identify and flag IPs with discrepancies between geolocation (`ip_geo`) and WHOIS registration (`ip_whois.country`).
- Generate alerts for malicious or suspicious IPs based on public blacklists.

### 6. Visual Analysis

- Create charts and statistics using libraries such as `matplotlib` or `Plotly` to show:
  - Geographic distribution of IPs.
  - Organizations or providers with the most records.

### 7.  Documentation and Automation

- **Improve Documentation**:
  - Create a guide for contributing to the project.
  - Add more advanced usage examples.
- **Automation**:
  - Create an installation or configuration script to facilitate deployment in new environments.
